## About Me

I am **Sadra Berangi**, an undergraduate student in **Computer Science and Engineering** at **Shahid Beheshti University**. My academic and research journey revolves around **artificial intelligence** and its broad applications, with experience in areas such as **machine learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, robotics and medical AI**.  

I have co-authored multiple research papers in international journals and conferences, covering topics from **interpretable deep learning** to **reinforcement learning** and **medical AI**. Beyond research, I have also gained hands-on experience as a **junior ML and vision engineer**, where I contributed to real-world projects involving **autonomous systems and intelligent decision-making**.  

I enjoy exploring how AI can address both **theoretical challenges** and **practical problems**, and I am eager to expand my expertise further through advanced studies and collaborations.
